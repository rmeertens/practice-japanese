"""Build per-JLPT-level kanji + meaning lists for the printable practice sheets.

Source data: davidluzgouveia/kanji-data (MIT), a KANJIDIC2-derived dataset
with an unofficial jlpt_new (N5-N1) level mapping matching the widely used
"Tanos" JLPT kanji lists. There is no single canonical order for these lists
(JLPT has not published an official kanji list since 2010, so every app/site
compiles and orders its own) — we sort by Japanese school grade (1-6, then
the secondary-school/jouyou grade 8, then non-jouyou grade 9), which is a
well-defined, independently verifiable convention. Written-frequency rank
breaks ties within a grade.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/generate_kanji_data.py <path-to-kanji-data.json>

Writes kanji-sheets/data/n5.json .. n1.json, each a list of
{"kanji": "...", "meaning": "..."} objects in practice-sheet order.

# Exact kanji order transcribed from the Benkyo app (screenshotted by a

# (N5: 80/80, N4: 167/167). There's no official JLPT kanji list to match
# against (JLPT hasn't published one since 2010), so every app orders its
# own — this hardcodes Benkyo's specific sequence for N5/N4 rather than
# trying to derive it. N3/N2/N1 fall back to the grade+frequency sort
# below since we don't have Benkyo's order for those.
